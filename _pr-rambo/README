__Usage__

Connects standard robotics control electronics to PatchRap. Intended both as wiring diagram or flexible PCB layout.

Typically <20 wires needed. Wirewrap should be fastest.


Please see '_pr-rambo_wirewrap.png' for a wirewrap wiring diagram, as well as '_build/cad/_pr-rambo/RenderTop.pdf' ,  '_build/cad/_pr-rambo/RenderBottom.pdf' for flexible PCB layouts.

As a wiring diagram, wirewrap, rainbow jumper cable, and T568A color schemes may be loaded with "gEDA_designer".


__Design__

To see intended or correct color coding PCB files must be opened with "_pcb_color_custom" provided by "gEDA_designer" . Alternative wiring diagram color schemes offered by "gEDA_designer" are typically made compatible on a best effort basis.

Layouts and enclosures chosen are typically made compatible with oil immersion cooling on a best effort basis.

A region of the control electronics near the stepper motor driver circuitry may be marked for compatibility with standard air/water heatsinks mounted on electrically insulating tape.


If a flexible PCB is used, additional insulating tape may be needed on the far side to ensure sharp pins do not scratch through the soldermask.
